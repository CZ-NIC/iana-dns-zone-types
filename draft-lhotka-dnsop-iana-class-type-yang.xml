    <abstract>
      <t>This document contains the initial revision of the YANG
      module iana-dns-class-rr-type that contains derived types
      reflecting two IANA registries: DNS CLASSes and Resource Record
      (RR) TYPEs. These YANG types are intended as a minimum basis for
      future data modeling work.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>YANG <xref target="RFC7950"/> has become a de facto standard
      as a language for modeling configuration and state data, as well
      as specifying management operations and asynchronous
      notifications. It is reasonable to expect that the approach
      based on utilizing such data models along with standard
      management protocols such as NETCONF and RESTCONF can be
      effectively used in DNS operations, too. In fact, several
      efforts are currently underway that attempt to use NETCONF or
      RESTCONF for configuring and managing
      <list style="symbols">
	<t>authoritative servers</t>
	<t>resolvers</t>
	<t>zone data.</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>While it is possible to use the management protocols
      mentioned above with ad hoc or proprietary data models, their
      real potential can be realized only if there is a (completely or
      partly) unified data model supported by multiple DNS software
      implementations. Operators can then, for instance, run several
      different DNS servers in parallel, and use a common
      configuration and management interface and data for all of
      them. Also, it becomes considerably easier to migrate to another
      implementation.</t>
      <t>Based on the previous experience from the IETF Routing Area,
      it is to be expected that the development of unified data models
      for DNS will be a lengthy and complicated process that will
      require active cooperation and compromises from the vendors and
      developers of major DNS server platforms. Nevertheless, it is
      likely that any DNS-related data modeling effort will need to
      use various DNS parameters and enumerations that are specified
      in several IANA registries. For use with YANG, these parameters
      and enumerations have to be translated into corresponding YANG
      types or other structures. Such translations should be
      straightforward and relatively uncontroversial.</t>
      <t>This document is a first step in translating DNS-related IANA
      registries to YANG. It contains the initial revision of the YANG
      module "iana-dns-class-rr-type" that defines derived types
      for the common parameters of DNS resource records (RR): class
      and type. These YANG types, "dns-class" and "rr-type", reflect
      the IANA registries "DNS CLASSes" and "Resource Record (RR)
      TYPEs" <xref target="IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS"/>.</t>
      <t>It is worth emphasizing that the role of the DNSOP Working
      Group is only in preparing and publishing this initial revision
      of the YANG module. Subsequently, whenever a new class or RR
      type is added to the above registries, IANA will also update the
      iana-dns-class-rr-type YANG module, following the instructions
      in <xref target="iana"/> below.</t>

    <section anchor="design" title="YANG Design Considerations">

      <t>The IANA document "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters" <xref
      target="IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS"/> contains altogether thirteen
      registries. The YANG module iana-dns-class-rr-type defines
      derived types corresponding to only two of the registries that
      are essential for data models involving zone data, namely "DNS
      CLASSes" and "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs". It is expected that
      the remaining registries in <xref
      target="IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS"/>, as well as other DNS-related
      IANA registries, will be analogically reflected in future YANG
      modules as necessary. This way, an appropriate combination of
      YANG modules can be chosen depending on which YANG types are
      needed for a given data modeling purpose.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC3597"/> introduced the option of specifying
      a class or type via its assigned decimal number, as an
      alternative to the mnemonic name. For example, the "IN" class
      can be equivalently written as "CLASS1", and "AAAA" type as
      "TYPE28".</t>
      <t>Accordingly, the derived types "dns-class" and "rr-type" are
      defined in the YANG module as a union of two member types:
      <list style="symbols">
	<t>16-bit decimal integer ("uint16")</t>
	<t>mnemonic name, represented by the enumeration type
	"dns-class-name" and "rr-type-name", respectively.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      <t>As unassigned and reserved class and types values are not
      included in the mnemonic name enumerations, they can be used only
      via their decimal codes.</t>

      <t>This document defines the initial version of the
      IANA-maintained iana-dns-class-rr-type YANG module.</t>
      <t>The iana-dns-class-rr-type YANG module is intended to reflect the
      "DNS CLASSes" and "Resource Record (RR)
      TYPEs" registries in <xref
      target="IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS"/>.</t>
      <t>IANA has added this new note to the "iana-dns-class-rr-type
      YANG Module" registry:</t>

      <figure>
        <artwork>
   Classes and types of DNS resource records must not be directly
   added to the iana-dns-class-rr-type YANG module. They must instead
   be added to the "DNS CLASSes" and "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs"
   registries, respectively.
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>When a new DNS class or RR type is added to the "DNS CLASSes"
      or "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" registry, a new "enum" statement
      must be added to the "dns-class-name" or "rr-type-name" type,
      respectively. The assigned name defined by the "enum" statement
      is the same as the mnemonic name of the new class or type. The
      following substatements to the "enum" statement should be
      defined:

      <list style="hanging" hangIndent="15">
        <t hangText="&quot;value&quot;:">Use the decimal value from
        the registry.</t>
        <t hangText="&quot;status&quot;:">Include only if a class or
        type registration has been deprecated (use the value
        "deprecated") or obsoleted (use the value "obsolete").</t>
        <t hangText="&quot;description&quot;:">Replicate the
        corresponding information from the registry, namely the full
        name of the new DNS class, or the meaning of the new RR type,
        if any.</t>
        <t hangText="&quot;reference&quot;:">Replicate the reference
        from the registry, if any, and add the title of the document,
        if applicable.</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>Unassigned or reserved values are not included in the
      "dns-class-name" and "rr-type-name" enumeration types.</t>
      <t>Each time the iana-dns-class-rr-type YANG module is updated, a new
      "revision" statement must be added before the existing
      "revision" statements.</t>
      
      <t>IANA has added this new note to the "DNS CLASSes" and
      "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" registries:</t>
      <figure>
        <artwork>
   When this registry is modified, the YANG module
   iana-dns-class-rr-type must be updated as defined in RFC XXXX.

    <abstract>
      <t>This document introduces the YANG
      module "iana-dns-class-rr-type" that contains derived types
      reflecting two IANA registries: DNS CLASSes and Resource Record
      (RR) TYPEs. These YANG types are intended as a minimum basis for
      future data modeling work.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>YANG <xref target="RFC7950"/> has become a de facto standard
      as a language for modeling configuration and state data, as well
      as specifying management operations and asynchronous
      notifications. It is reasonable to expect that the approach
      based on utilizing such data models along with standard
      management protocols such as NETCONF and RESTCONF can be
      effectively used in DNS operations, too. In fact, several
      efforts are currently underway that attempt to use NETCONF or
      RESTCONF for configuring and managing</t>
      <ul>
        <li>authoritative servers</li>
        <li>resolvers</li>
        <li>zone data.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>While it is possible to use the management protocols
      mentioned above with ad hoc or proprietary data models, their
      real potential can be realized only if there is a (completely or
      partly) unified data model supported by multiple DNS software
      implementations. Operators can then, for instance, run several
      DNS server implementations in parallel, and use a common
      configuration and management interface and data for all of
      them. Also, it becomes considerably easier to migrate to another
      implementation.</t>
      <t>Based on the previous experience from the IETF Routing Area,
      it is to be expected that the development of unified data models
      for DNS will be a lengthy and complicated process that will
      require active cooperation and compromises from the vendors and
      developers of major DNS server platforms. Nevertheless, it is
      likely that any DNS-related data modeling effort will need to
      use various DNS parameters and enumerations that are specified
      in several IANA registries. For use with YANG, these parameters
      and enumerations have to be translated into corresponding YANG
      types or other structures. Such translations should be
      straightforward and relatively uncontroversial.</t>
      <t>This document provides a translation of two fundamental
      DNS-related IANA registries to YANG. It contains the initial
      revision of the YANG module "iana-dns-class-rr-type" that
      defines derived types for the common parameters of DNS resource
      records (RR): class and type. These YANG types, "dns-class" and
      "rr-type", reflect the IANA registries "DNS CLASSes" and
      "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" <xref
      target="IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS"/>.</t>
      <t><xref target="app.xslt"/> contains an XSLT 1.0 stylesheet
      that is intended to be used by IANA for generating the initial
      revision of the "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG
      module. Subsequently, whenever a new class or RR type is added
      to the above registries, IANA will also update the
      "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG module, following the instructions
      in <xref target="iana"/> below.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

      &kw-2119;

      <t>The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
      <xref target="RFC7950"/>.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="design" title="YANG Design Considerations">

      <t>The IANA document "Domain Name System (DNS) Parameters" <xref
      target="IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS"/> contains altogether thirteen
      registries. The YANG module "iana-dns-class-rr-type" defines
      derived types corresponding to only two of the registries that
      are essential for data models involving zone data, namely "DNS
      CLASSes" and "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs". It is expected that
      the remaining registries in <xref
      target="IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS"/>, as well as other DNS-related
      IANA registries, will be analogously reflected in future YANG
      modules as necessary. This way, an appropriate combination of
      YANG modules can be chosen depending on which YANG types are
      needed for a given data modeling purpose.</t>
      <t>The registries "DNS CLASSes" and "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs"
      are transformed into YANG enumeration types "dns-class-name" and
      "rr-type-name", respectively. This is the initial fragment of
      the former:</t>

      <sourcecode type="yang">
  typedef dns-class-name {
    type enumeration {
      enum IN {
        value 1;
        description
          "Internet (IN)";
        reference
          "RFC 1035";
      }
      ...
    }
    ...
  }
      </sourcecode>
      <t>The other derived type, "rr-type-name", is defined
      similarly.</t>

      <t><xref target="RFC3597"/> introduced the option of specifying
      a class or RR type via its assigned decimal number, as an
      alternative to the mnemonic name. For example, the "IN" class
      can be equivalently written as "CLASS1", and "AAAA" type can be
      written as "TYPE28".</t>
      <t>Accordingly, the derived types "dns-class" and "rr-type" are
      defined in the YANG module as a union of two member types:</t>
      <ul>
        <li>16-bit decimal integer ("uint16")</li>
        <li>mnemonic name belonging to the enumerations
        "dns-class-name" and "rr-type-name", respectively.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>For instance, the "rr-type" type is defined as follows:</t>
      <sourcecode type="yang">
  typedef rr-type {
    type union {
      type uint16;
      type rr-type-name;
    }
    description
      "This type allows for referring to a DNS resource record type
       using either the assigned mnemonic name or numeric value.";
  }
      </sourcecode>
      <t>As unassigned and reserved class and RR type values are not
      included in the mnemonic name enumerations, they can only be specified
      using their decimal values.</t>

    <section anchor="iana" title="IANA Considerations">

      &ed-hint-rfcno;

      <t>This section deals with actions and processes necessary for
      IANA to undertake to maintain the "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG
      module. This YANG module is intended to reflect the "DNS
      CLASSes" and "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" registries in <xref
      target="IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS"/>. The most recent revision of the
      YANG module is available from the "YANG Parameters" registry <xref
      target="IANA-YANG-PARAMETERS"/>.</t>

      <t>Upon publication of this document, the initial revision of the
      "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG module SHALL be created by applying
      the XSLT stylesheet from <xref target="app.xslt"/> to the XML
      version of <xref target="IANA-DNS-PARAMETERS"/>.</t>

      <t>IANA SHALL add this note to the "iana-dns-class-rr-type" item
      of the "YANG Module Names" registry <xref
      target="IANA-YANG-PARAMETERS"/>:</t>

      <blockquote>
        Classes and types of DNS resource records must not be directly
        added to the "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG module. They must
        instead be added to the "DNS CLASSes" and "Resource Record
        (RR) TYPEs" registries, respectively.
      </blockquote>

      <t>When a new DNS class or RR type is added to the "DNS CLASSes"
      or "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" registry, a new "enum" statement
      SHALL be added to the "dns-class-name" or "rr-type-name" type,
      respectively. The assigned name defined by the "enum" statement
      SHALL be the same as the mnemonic name of the new class or
      type. The following substatements to the "enum" statement SHALL
      be defined:</t>

      <dl>
        <dt>&quot;value&quot;:</dt>
	<dd>Use the decimal value from the registry.</dd>
        <dt>&quot;status&quot;:</dt>
	<dd>Include only if a class or type registration has been
	deprecated or obsoleted. In both cases, use the value
	"obsolete" as the argument of the "status" statement.</dd>
        <dt>&quot;description&quot;:</dt>
	<dd>Replicate the corresponding information from the registry,
	namely the full name of the new DNS class, or the meaning of
	the new RR type, if any.</dd>
        <dt>&quot;reference&quot;:</dt>
	<dd>Replicate the reference(s) from the registry.</dd>
      </dl>
      <t>Unassigned or reserved values SHALL NOT be included in the
      "dns-class-name" and "rr-type-name" enumeration types.</t>
      <t>Each time the "iana-dns-class-rr-type" YANG module is updated, a new
      "revision" statement SHALL be added before the existing
      "revision" statements.</t>
      
      <t>IANA SHALL add this new note to the "DNS CLASSes" and
      "Resource Record (RR) TYPEs" registries:</t>
      <blockquote>
	When this registry is modified, the YANG module
	"iana-dns-class-rr-type" must be updated as defined in RFC
	XXXX.
      </blockquote>

      <t>The "Reference" text in the "DNS CLASSes" registry SHALL be
      updated as follows:</t>
      <blockquote>
        <artwork>
OLD:
  [RFC6895]

NEW:

# 
# RELAX NG schema for YIN with extensions for HTML markup.
# 
# NOTE:
# 
# This schema extends yin.rng by adding support for the following
# non-standard YIN extension:
# 
# Arguments of 'contact', 'description', 'organization' and 'reference'
# (wrapped in <text>) may contain the following HTML elements in the
# "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" namespace:
# 
# <html:p> - a paragraph of text
# <html:ul> - unordered list
# <html:ol> - ordered list
# 
# <html:p> elements may, apart from text, also contain empty
# <html:br/> elements that cause an unconditional line break.
# 
# List elements must contain one or more <html:li> elements
# representing list items with text and <html:br/> elements.
# 
# A <text> element may also have the xml:id attribute and contain the
# XInclude element <xi:include>.
